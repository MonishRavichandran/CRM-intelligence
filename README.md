CRM and Growth Strategy: Diagnostics and Optimization Plan
üöÄ Project Overview
This project serves as a comprehensive strategic report and analytical dashboard designed to address critical inefficiencies within a company's lead-to-customer pipeline. The goal was to establish a data-driven CRM framework, diagnose the root cause of high Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), and design a multi-track nurturing mechanism to prevent high-quality leads from "falling through the cracks."

The final deliverable consists of a Power BI Report for data visualization and a Strategic Document detailing the system logic and optimization plan.

üéØ Key Business Challenge
The project was initiated to solve three core problems identified by leadership:

High CAC: The blended Cost per Acquisition was unsustainable, particularly in certain channels.

Pipeline Leakage: High volumes of leads were stalling or going cold, wasting sales team effort.

Lack of System: The CRM lacked defined stages, automations, and a mechanism to accurately measure lead intent.

üìä Data-Driven Diagnosis (Key Findings)
The analysis, detailed in the Power BI Report (Page 2 & 4), established the following:

Finding                 Metric                          Impact
High Financial Leak     Facebook Ads CAC: ‚Çπ3,000        This channel is 7.5x more expensive than the most efficient channel (Email).

Poor Traffic Quality    Facebook Ads CR: 1.0%           The lowest conversion rate confirms low intent leads are flooding the funnel.

System Failure          Stalled Lead Count: 40          40 leads are stuck in the "Lead" or "MQL" stage for over 14 days, confirming the need for a targeted nurturing system.

Friction Point          MQL to SQL Conversion Leakage   70% of qualified MQLs fail to move to the Sales Qualified (SQL) stage.


üõ†Ô∏è Strategic Solution and System Design
The proposed solution implements a Value Alignment philosophy, prioritizing quality over volume.

1. New CRM Logic (Page 2)
Lead Scoring: Implemented the Lead Score and a new Intent Level field to classify leads as High, Mid, or Low Intent.

Automation: Introduced the Stalled Lead Alert to trigger immediate action whenever a lead is inactive for more than 14 days.

2. Nurturing Mechanism (Page 3)
A three-track system was designed to address leads based on their intent level, replacing the previous "one-size-fits-all" approach:

High Intent Track: Immediate, personalized sales outreach.

Mid Intent Track: Value-driven educational content (case studies) over 7-14 days.

Low Intent Track: Long-term re-engagement content focusing on product awareness.

3. Optimization Plan (Page 4)
Two key experiments were proposed to reduce the Facebook Ads CAC by 40%:

Experiment 1 (Upstream): Implement stricter geo-targeting and layered psychographic targeting in ad platforms to increase initial lead quality.

Experiment 2 (Downstream): Introduce a two-question qualification form on the landing page to filter out low-intent users before they enter the CRM.
